<h2>Machine Learning Project: ANTICIPATION FOR US HIGHER EDUCATION</h2>
    <h2>Application Title:ADMIT ACHIEVE</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the Admit Achieve project page! We are excited to share the details of our machine learning project with you.
</p>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    In the present competitive era, admissions into masterâ€™s program in prestigious universities
    has become an arduous task because of the ever-increasing competition leading to higher standards
    while shortlisting aspirants and challenging for grabbing an admit.Considering the cumbersome
    nature of the admission process, students often get muddled because of its various factors under
    consideration. Keeping this view in context, a sound model is proposed that could predict the
    chances of getting an admit, along with students leveraging the fact of forecast their chances of
    an admit beforehand applying.The data has been collected by our team for which prediction is going
    to be done with the help of an android app in the front end and by applying suitable data pre-processing
    techniques and accuracy checks at the back. This model is prepared by using Linear Regression algorithm.
    We compare the efficiency of the algorithms, the efficient algorithm chosen for mode building.
    This also reducing workload for the admissions committee by automating this tedious task.
